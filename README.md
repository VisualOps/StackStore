Welcome to VisualOps' stack repository
==============================================
Description
-----------

The repositories contains some stack templates that could be imported and used in [VisualOps](http://www.visualops.io).

VisualOps automates the tasks of resource provisioning, code deployment, and configuration management to ensure your cloud application always runs in the desired state. Imagine that you can compose the actual systems similar to the way you draw the conceptual diagrams: drag & drop icons, connect them, describe their configuration, and start the whole application by a single click. While you focus on the architecture, the rest of the “heavy-lifting” work is left to us.

VisualOps is created with a goal of both "super easy to understand" and "total control". We believe these two factors are important for any size of users to adopt a technology, whether this means individual project, startup, ISV, enterprise and everywhere in between. VisualOps is appropriate for managing small setups with a handful of instances as well as complicated environments with many thousands.
